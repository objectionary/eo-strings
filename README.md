**This repository is deprecated! We've moved all EO objects from this repository
to [objectionary/eo](https://github.com/objectionary/eo).**

[EO](https://www.eolang.org) objects for manipulations with strings.

This is how it works:

### Text
The object `QQ.txt.text` is a decorator of `QQ.string`.

The attribute `is-empty` is TRUE if the length of the tuple is zero.

The attribute `trim` is a new string trimmed from both sides.

The attribute `joined` is a string that was obtained by concatenating
the strings from the tuple with the current string as a delimiter.

The attribute `contains` is TRUE if current string contains
`substr` as a substring.

The attribute `ends-with` is TRUE if current string 
ends with `substr`.

The attribute `starts-with` is TRUE if current string
starts with `substr`.

The attribute `index-of` is an index of `substr` in
current string as a substring.

The attribute `lower-case` is a new string in lower case.

The attribute `upper-case` is a new string in upper case.

The attribute `at` is a one sign from string by index.

The attribute `replaced` a new string where all substrings
`target` was changed to `replacement`.

The attribute `as-int` is an int object derived from the string.

The attribute `as-float` is a float object derived from the string.

The attribute `compare` is an int value -
result of comparing in lexicographic order.
Returns 0 if two strings are equal,
a negative number if the first string comes before the argument,
a positive number if the first string comes after the argument.


```
[] > text-test
  QQ.hamcrest.assert-that > @
    trim.
      text
        lower-case.
          text
            " AbC "
    $.equal-to "abc"
```
